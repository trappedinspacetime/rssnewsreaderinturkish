At the top of the screen, in a marquee style, an RSS reader that displays the news received by the RSS Newsletter by scrolling from left to right and reads it out loud. When we hover the mouse over the relevant news, it shows the content of the news as a tooltip. And when clicked, it opens the source of the news in the browser. I wrote it with the help of artificial intelligence using Pygobject.
